title: Docs for Our Research Group
type: book  
summary: 
---

Think of these docs as a kind of "operating manual" for research and writing in the research group. They won't provide answers to every question, but they outline a core set of tools and processes you'll need to do your work in the group successfully. The key to that success is ***effective collaboration***. Anyone can develop a system for writing and research that meets their own needs and is suitable for working on their own. But to collaborate effectively, we need shared tools and common ways of working that are feasible for everyone to use and follow day-to-day, allowing us to communicate easily with each other and to focus on building knowledge that is well organized and accessible.
