# Docs for the Workshop

Think of these docs as a kind of "operating manual" for research and writing at the Workshop. They won't provide answers to every question, but they will outline a core set of tools and processes you'll need to do your work successfully. The key to that success is *effective collaboration*. Anyone can develop a system for writing and research that meets their own needs and is suitable for writing and researching on their own. But to collaborate effectively, we need shared tools and common ways of working that are feasible for everyone to use and follow day-to-day, allowing us to communicate easily with each other and to focus on building knowledge that is well organized and accessible.
