This is the web portal for [Dr. Jamie Baxter's](../authors/baxter) research group based at the Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University. We work mainly on *collaborative, place-based projects* related to land, local governance, and regional food systems, as well as projects on open authorship in legal education. 

On this site you will find info about our [current and past projects](#projects), [members in the group](#people), and access to [recent publications](#publications). Some projects are hosted on their own site--please feel free to explore.
