abstract: Despite growing attention to open educational resources in higher education, there is little evidence that the movement toward “open” has yet been embraced by Canadian law teachers. In this paper, we make an early attempt to compile the available data on open legal casebooks produced for use in Canadian law schools and we engage with the literature of commons-based peer production to develop a theory explaining why collaborative engagement has been slow to date. We then describe how we think Canadian law teachers can overcome current barriers to collaborative open casebook authorship, using an experimental property law casebook project we are developing to illustrate. 

summary: A paper examining open casebook development among Canadian law teachers and developing a theoretical and applied framework for improving collaborative authorship.
